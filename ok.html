<h2>What is the Virtual DOM?</h2>
<pre>
The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation.

<h2>What is SPA</h2>
<pre>
A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that is designed to be displayed as a single, static page.

This approach makes the application more user-friendly and easier to navigate, as users can see the entire application at once.

With a traditional web application, users are redirected to a new page every time they make a change to their data, which can be frustrating if they want to edit information in multiple places.

In contrast, SPA-based applications are completely focused on one thing at a time, allowing users to work through each step in a consistent manner.

<h2>What is difference between class and functional component</h2>
<pre>
 Class Component: This is the bread and butter of most modern web apps built in ReactJS. These components are simple classes (made up of multiple functions that add functionality to the application).

Syntax:

class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}

Functional Components: Functional components are some of the more common components that will come across while working in React. These are simply JavaScript functions. We can create a functional component to React by writing a JavaScript function.

Syntax:

const Car=()=> {
  return Hi, I am also a Car!;
}

<h2>What do you mean by state and its use in react? </h2>
<pre>
The state is an instance of React Component Class can be defined as an object of a set of observable properties that control the behavior of the component. In other words, the State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.
useState is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components. You pass the initial state to this function and it returns a variable with the current state value (not necessarily the initial state) and another function to update this value.

<h2>
What is JSX and why do we use it instead of js?
</h2>


<pre>
 JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement() and/or appendChild() methods. JSX converts HTML tags into react elements. You are not required to use JSX, but JSX makes it easier to write React applications.

JS is simply a scripting language, adding functionality into your website. JSX is an addition to the JavaScript syntax which is a mixture of both HTML and JavaScript. Both JS and JSX are interchangeable but JSX makes the code easier to understand for users

<h2> What is package.json </h2>

<pre>
The package. json file is the heart of any Node project. It records important metadata about a project which is required before publishing to NPM, and also defines functional attributes of a project that npm uses to install dependencies, run scripts, and identify the entry point to our package.
